Compartments: string chopped in 2 halfs

1st compartment: vJrwpWtwJgWr
2nd compartment: hcsFMMfFFhFp
Shared items: p

1st compartment: jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGL
2nd compartment: rsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL
Shared items: L

.. P, v, t, s

Priority:
    a-z: 1-26
    A-Z: 27-52

Sum of priorities for p (16), L (28), P (42), v (22), t (20) and s (19) is 157
Meaning the answer would be 157 compared to a sample
